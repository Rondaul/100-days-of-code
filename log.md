# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on testing android app. Learned to create unit tests and unit test using fakes.

**Thoughts:** It was exciting to learn testing android apps. I always felt testing was complex and tough but I never learnt it well thoroughly. For now, its going great.
