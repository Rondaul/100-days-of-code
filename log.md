# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on testing android app. Learned to create unit tests and unit test using fakes.

**Thoughts:** It was exciting to learn testing android apps. I always felt testing was complex and tough but I never learnt it well thoroughly. For now, its going great.

### Day 3: August 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on testing android app. 
1. Learned dependency injection by creating custom service locator.
2. Learn to create UI test using espresso and mockito

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed todays topic. Espresso and Mockito are such great tools. Here I have used service locator. I have read somewhere that service locator is not a good approach. So, I will be trying other forms of DI next
