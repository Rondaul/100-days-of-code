# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on testing android app. Learned to create unit tests and unit test using fakes.

**Thoughts:** It was exciting to learn testing android apps. I always felt testing was complex and tough but I never learnt it well thoroughly. For now, its going great.

### Day 2: August 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on testing android app. 
1. Created test for android viewmodels using fake repository class.
2. Learned to create instrumented unit test.
3. Learn to test fragment using fragmentScenerio in instrumentation test.

**Thoughts:** Learn an important part of testing android app. It was a great day. Got to learn a new topic.

### Day 3: August 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on testing android app. 
1. Learned dependency injection by creating custom service locator.
2. Learn to create UI test using espresso and mockito

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed todays topic. Espresso and Mockito are such great tools. Here I have used service locator. I have read somewhere that service locator is not a good approach. So, I will be trying other forms of DI next

### Day 4: August 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started dagger 2 tutorial app. 
1. Learned about Dependency Injection
2. Learned about basics of dagger2 concepts like inject, component, module, binds, bindsInstance and factory

**Thoughts:** Started DI today. Learn important concepts of dagger2. Dagger2 is a good library for DI but i found two problems from my observation till now. 
1. We can inject private fields.
2. Dagger2 is too verbose. Too much setup code.

### Day 5: August 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started dagger 2 tutorial app. 
1. Learned and added scopes and subcomponents to the app

**Thoughts:** little confusing to understand these concepts but I managed and learnt it. Lot of boilerplate code. Lot of code to make one registration flow work.

### Day 6: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started dagger 2 tutorial app. 
1. Worked on scoping multiple activities in one component
2. testing dagger

**Thoughts:** Still I find some things confusing but its getting clearer why things are as such. Components section are the one that I find particularly confusing. Hope things gets clearly as I keep practicing this topics more.

### Day 7: August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked dagger 2 tutorial app. 
1. Learn more on dagger 2
2. added more test for other dagger supported classes

**Thoughts:** Kept learning more on dagger 2 tutorial with testing included

### Day 8: August 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working o hilt DI android app. 
1. Start working on Hilt DI

**Thoughts:** I found hilt to be quite and improvement to dagger 2. It took the good parts and made things easier to setup the dependency graph. Still there are some things which is not great but it still is better than dagger 2 and hopefully other DI which I will explore soon.
